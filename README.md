This is a project is a Password Generator that I refactored 
The content and the style was previously provided 
The functionality is very basic but it works 
On the error alert part I used an external library that provides the css code,in this case was very easy to use. 
But when I also tried to  replace the confirm method  with a similar approach than  the alert case  I couldnt make it. 
This code can be improved and I guess it can holds lot of improvements.
An screenshot on the assets folder has the preview of the deployed website.
